### Welcome to my GitHub page!

GitHub does not provide adequate support for the interactive visualizations that I often make using Python's plotly package. In fact, you might not even see them at all while scrolling through the notebook.

To circumvent that, please use this [link](https://nbviewer.org/github/Tinashe-04/) to view all of my GitHub repositories. Once you can see all of my repositories and Jupyter notebooks, you will be able to select a repository and scroll through any of the Jupyter notebook files contained within that repository (that is, all files with the file extension .ipynb at the end). This will allow you to view my projects with full functionality!

Among the many repositories that I have, the most recent and most comprehensive notebook so far can be found in the CareerPalz repository and is titled LCA_Disclosure_Data_FY2023_complete_year.ipynb. It shows unique insights extracted from the Department of Labor's publicly disclosed data on Labor Condition Applications for foreign specialty workers in the U.S. This notebook is part of a project that I am currently working on with CareerPalz, a nonprofit organization that focuses on the career development of postsecondary international students in the U.S.

For any questions, please feel free to email me at maparuram@gmail.com.
